# Zotero JCR Citations

This is an add-on for Zotero, a research source management tool. The add-on automatically fetches numbers of citations of your Zotero items from JCR index and makes it possible to sort your items by the citations. Moreover, it allows batch updating the citations, as they may change over time.

All this thing is based on Zotero Schoolar Citation plugin. https://github.com/beloglazov/zotero-scholar-citations
